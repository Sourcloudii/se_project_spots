**Intro**
  
This is my third project as an aspiring software engineer here at TripleTen. Spots is a web app where users will be able to upload photos, like other users posts, and make small adjustments to their profile. I will heopfully cointinue to improve this project in the future as m yskills increase overtime.
  
**Figma**  
  
* [Link to the project on Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/BBNm2bC3lj8QQMHlnqRsga/Sprint-3-Project-%E2%80%94-Spots?type=design&node-id=2%3A60&mode=design&t=afgNFybdorZO6cQo-1)
  
**Images**  
  
The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma â€” we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster. 
  
Good luck and have fun!
